This is a small collection of dotfiles I use for almost all of my linux systems. These should be able to be used anywhere the base package, but they were created on arch.\
I use the neofetch one all the time, one of my favorites I've made.\

###These packages must be included for **all** the dotfiles to work (you may cherry pick the ones you like):
i3\
lightdm\
slick-greeter\
kitty\
polybar\
acpi\
dunst\
i3lock-color\
gtk-theme-material-black\
papirus-icon-theme\
lxappearance\
i3gaps

These files must be included for most notifications to work:\
libnotify\
glibmm\
notify-sharp-3\
go-notify-git\
java-gnome\
gjs\
lua-lgi-git
